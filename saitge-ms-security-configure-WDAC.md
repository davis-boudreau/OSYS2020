## To enable Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC), whitelist and blacklist applications, and test blocking unauthorized software execution, follow these steps:

### 1. Enable WDAC
1. **Create a WDAC Policy**:
   - Open PowerShell as an administrator.
   - Use the `New-CIPolicy` cmdlet to create a new WDAC policy:
     ```powershell
     New-CIPolicy -Level PcaCertificate -FilePath "C:\WDAC\MyPolicy.xml"
     ```

2. **Deploy the Policy**:
   - Convert the policy XML file to a binary format:
     ```powershell
     ConvertFrom-CIPolicy -XmlFilePath "C:\WDAC\MyPolicy.xml" -BinaryFilePath "C:\WDAC\MyPolicy.bin"
     ```
   - Deploy the binary policy file:
     ```powershell
     Copy-Item "C:\WDAC\MyPolicy.bin" "C:\Windows\System32\CodeIntegrity\SIPolicy.p7b"
     ```

3. **Enable WDAC**:
   - Restart your workstation to apply the policy.

### 2. Whitelist and Blacklist Applications
1. **Edit the Policy XML**:
   - Open the policy XML file in a text editor.
   - Add rules to whitelist or blacklist applications. For example, to whitelist an application:
     ```xml
     <FileRule Id="ID_ALLOW_APP" FriendlyName="MyApp" Action="Allow">
       <FilePath>Path\To\MyApp.exe</FilePath>
     </FileRule>
     ```
   - To blacklist an application:
     ```xml
     <FileRule Id="ID_DENY_APP" FriendlyName="BlockedApp" Action="Deny">
       <FilePath>Path\To\BlockedApp.exe</FilePath>
     </FileRule>
     ```

2. **Update the Policy**:
   - Convert the updated XML file to binary and redeploy it as shown in the previous steps.

### 3. Test Blocking Unauthorized Software Execution
1. **Run Unauthorized Software**:
   - Attempt to run an application that is not whitelisted.
   - WDAC should block the execution and log the event.

2. **Check Event Logs**:
   - Open Event Viewer and navigate to `Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > CodeIntegrity > Operational`.
   - Look for events indicating blocked applications.
